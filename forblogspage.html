    <section style="width: 52%; margin: auto;">


        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: -1.1rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">December, 2021</p>
        <hr>


        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.2rem;">I was in Navgurukul Dhramshala campus in Himachal Pradesh where I was doing my coding course. In our campus there were no teachers or professors but students of the previous batch known as mentors, mostly students used to study by themselves. </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.2rem;">One day some of the students were talking about visiting a place nearby. I had heard that Himachal is the beauty of nature. In my village my school teachers and guidance  used to discuss the mountains ,waterfalls ,snows and weather of the Himachal. So I was also excited to visit any place in Himachal, so I joined the conversation and asked to go with them but everyone was confused to decide where to visit and the discussion went for days and some more students joined us. Finally we all decided to ask our team members who used to manage the campus and placement of the students in companies. They said as it is the month of September we are not going to enjoy the snow but we can visit Triund which is 9 km from the city of Mcleodganj. They also described the beauty of the Triund. Everyone was convinced to visit Triund and agreed to leave the campus the next morning.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.2rem;">We woke up early in the morning and packed our bags. We were in groups of five. At Fatehpur we purchased our food as we were going to spend a night at the hills. Then we took the bus to Mcleodganj and from Mcleodganj we took 25 minutes to reach Gallu Mata temple(12pm). As we reached Gallu Mata temple we enquired about the way to our destination and we were informed that since it's been drizzling and raining for 2 days we can't go to the hills as there can be landslides. The police women were on duty and They had stopped the way so no one could enter.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.2rem;">
            Everyone was disappointed as we were returning to Mcleodganj but as we reached Mcleodgunj some students found out that there is another way to reach Triund from the upper side of Mcleodganj but that way will be too long. Everyone started thinking about whether we should go or not. Some were planning to visit other places and some were talking about how we had decided we would go. Out of 34 students, 7 students went back and the rest started walking to our destination(1:30pm). Now we were filled with happiness(you can understand the khushi). As we walked for nearly 1 km everyone was tired because it is not that easy for coders who are used to sitting in one place for hours. But as we reached some height we felt a different kind of feeling: no house for long distances, no vehicle sounds but different kinds of trees , bushes, rocks, stones and hills. After walking for 2 hours we sat near a waterfall and ate our lunch and again started our journey. For not keeping our mind on our tiredness we used to sing, joke, rest for 5 minutes again start. Then we came by some stalls and the owner of the stalls were selling one litre water bottle for 50 rupees and 10 rupees chips packet for 50 rupees.
           </p>
           <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 1.2rem;">At 6:30 pm we finally reached the peak of Triund. It was like stepping into heaven because clouds were below the mountains and we could look for the distances. There were horses and full green grass around us. We lay down for some time and enjoyed the view, after that we started looking for a place to stay at night. After going a little down to the other side of the mountain, we found a type of farmhouse. We asked the owner if we could stay the night and he agreed and asked for some rent. Then we ate our dinner. It was very cold at night, and we were thankful to that owner who had given us blankets. Next morning we woke up early, we roamed around, we clicked lots of selfies and made videos. We stayed at the top till 12:28 pm and we started our journey back to the campus. While returning we met some tourists and clicked some photos with them. We rested at some places but this time we quickly came down at 4 pm and ate our lunch in the Dharamshala and were back in our campus at 6 pm. We are completely tired and amazed after trekking the mountains. </p>
